(** Server to client notifications.

    This module makes possible for client side applications to be
    notified of changes on some indexed data on the server.

    Apply functor [Make] for each type of data you want to be able to listen on.
    Each client starts listening on one piece of data by calling function
    [listen] with the index of that piece of data as parameter.
    Client stops listening by calling function [unlisten],
    or when the client side state is closed (by timeout or when the user
    logs out for example).

    When the data is modified on server side, call function [notify]
    with the index of the data, and all clients listening to that piece
    of data will receive a notification. Function [notify] takes as parameter
    the function that will build a customize notification for each user.
    (Be careful to check that user has right to see this data at this moment).

    The functor will also create a client side react signal that will
    be updated every time the client is notified.
*)

(** we have two types of notifications ([server_notif], and [client_notif])
    because we might need to serialise and deserialise the notification twice.
    Once for broadcasting it to other servers (in case of a multi-server set-up)
    and once for transferring it to the client (after possibly transforming the
    message using information which is only disponible at the receiving server
    (see [prepare] below).

  (** Stop listening on data [key] *)

  (** Make a user stop listening on data [key] *)
  val unlisten_user :
    ?sitedata:Eliom_common.sitedata -> userid:Os_types.User.id -> key -> unit

  (** Call [notify id] to send a notification to all clients currently
      listening on data [key].

      If [~notfor] is [`Me], notification will not be sent to the tab
      currently doing the request (the one which caused the notification to
      happen). If it is [`User id] it won't be sent to the user with id [id].

  (** Returns the client react event. Map a function on this event to react
      to notifications from the server.
      For example:
[{server{
  let _ = Os_session.on_start_process
    (fun () ->
       ignore {unit{ ignore (React.E.map handle_notif %(N.client_ev ())) }};
       Lwt.return ()
