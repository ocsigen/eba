(** The connection wrapper checks whether the user is connected,
    and calls the page generator accordingly.
    It is usually recommended to have both a connected and non-connected
    version of each page. By default, the non-connected version
    will display a connection form.

    If connected, [gen_wrapper connected non_connected gp pp]
    calls the [connected] function given as parameters,
    taking user id, GET parameters [gp] and POST parameters [pp].

    If not, it calls the [not_connected] function.

    If we are launching a new client side process,
    functions [on_start_process] is called,
    and also [on_start_connected_process] if connected.

    If [allow] or [deny] are present, it will check that the user belongs
    or not to these groups, and call function [deny_fun] otherwise.
    By default, it raises [Permission_denied].
