    For the client side value, we could use a wrapped reference but
    - the value must be set before wrapping, otherwise we will wrap a lwt
    thread ... We need a wrapper that waits the end of the server side threads
    and wrap the value it returns?
    - if they are sent only once, the value will be wrong because when
    the client side program starts, the value is None
    - if they are sent every request, it's too much, and this is probably
    not the right semantics for wrapping Eliom references
