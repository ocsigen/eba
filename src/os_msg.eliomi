[%%shared.start]

(** Call this function either from client or server side
    to display an error message in the page.
    The message is displayed in a special box (a div with id [os-msg]
    created automatically in the body of the page if not already present).
    It is displayed during a short amount of time then disappears. You may
    change the duration in seconds with the parameter [duration] (default 2
    seconds).
    The two levels correspond to different classes that you can
    personalize by modifying the CSS class [os-err] (added for error messages to
    the box with ID os-msg).

    If [~onload] is [true], the message is displayed after the next page
    is displayed (default [false]). When called on server side, this is
    always the case.

(** [((firstname, lastname), (password, password_confirmation)) option]
    This reference is used to remember information about the user during a
    request when something went wrong (for example in a form when the password
    and password confirmation are not the same).
    If the value is [None], no user data has been set.
    Default is [None].
