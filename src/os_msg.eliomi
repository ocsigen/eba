[%%shared.start]

(** Call this function either from client or server side
    to display an error message in the page.
    The message is displayed in a special box (a div with id [os_msg]
    created automatically in the body of the page).
    It is displayed during a short amount of time then disappears. You may
    change the duration in seconds with the parameter [duration] (default 2
    seconds).
    The two levels correspond to different classes that you can
    personalize by modifying the CSS class [os_err] (added for error messages to
    the box with ID os_msg).

    If [~onload] is [true], the message is displayed after the next page
    is displayed (default [false]). When called on server side, this is
    always the case.
