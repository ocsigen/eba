(** [upload_pic_link ?a ?content ?crop ?input ?submit action_after_submit
    service userid]

    Creates a link with a label and a submit button to upload a picture.

    The client function [action_after_submit] will be called first,
    for example to close the menu containing the link.

    You can add attributes to the HTML tag with the optional parameter [?a].
    [?input] and [?submit] are couples [(attributes, content_children)] for the
    label and the submit button where [attributes] is a list of attributes for
    the tag and [content_children] is a list of children. By default, they are
    empty.

    [?content] is the link text. The default value is "Change profile picture".

    [service] is the service called to upload the picture.

    You can crop the picture by giving a value to [?crop].
