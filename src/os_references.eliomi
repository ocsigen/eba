(** This module defines some Eliom references. *)

[%%server.start]

(** Set to [true] if an action link key has been already created and sent to the
    user email, else [false]. Default is [false]. *)
val action_link_key_created : bool Eliom_reference.Volatile.eref

(** [((firstname, lastname), (password, password_confirmation)) option]
    This reference is used to remember information about the user during a
    request when something went wrong (for example in a form when the password
    and password confirmation are not the same).
    If the value is [None], no user data has been set.
    Default is [None].
