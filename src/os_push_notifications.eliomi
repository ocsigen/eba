(** Send push notifications to mobile clients.

    This module provides a simple OCaml interface to Google Cloud Messaging
    (GCM) to send push notifications to mobile devices. It is recommended to use
    https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-push client-side to
    receive push notifications on the mobile.

    This implementation is based on the payloads listed on this page:
    https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/blob/master/docs/PAYLOAD.md

    Before using this module, you need to register your mobile application in
    GCM and save the server key GCM will give you. You need to pass this key to
    {!send} when you want to send a notification.

    On the client, you will need first to register the device on GCM and save
    server-side the registered ID returned by GCM. You will use this ID when you
    will want to send a notification to the device. This step is described in
    the binding to the Cordova plugin phonegap-plugin-push available at this
    address: https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-push.
    Don't forget to add the plugin phonegap-plugin-push in the config.xml with
    your sender ID.

    To send a notification, you need to use [send server_key notification
    options] where [notification] is of type {!Notification.t] and [options] is
    of type {!Options.t}

    The type {!Options.t} contains the list of registered ID you want to send
    the notification [notification] to.
    You can create a value of type Options.t with [Options.create ids] where
    [ids] is a list of client ID. These ID's are the devices you want to send
    the notification to.

    The type {!Notification.t} contains the notification payloads. These
    payloads and their description are listed here:
    https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/blob/master/docs/PAYLOAD.md
    You can create an empty value of type {!Notification.t} with
    [Notification.empty ()]. As described in the link given above, you can add a
    title, a message, etc to the notification. In general, to add the payload
    [payload], you can use the function [add_(payload)]. The notification value
    is at the end to be able to use the pipe. For example, to add a title and a
    message, you can use:
      Notification.empty () |>
      add_title "Hello, World!" |>
      add_message "Message to the world!"

    (** Add a notification ID. By default, a new notification replaces the last
        one because they have the same ID. By adding a different ID for two
        different notifications, two notifications will be shown in the
        notification area instead of one. If a new notification has the same ID
        as an older one, the new one will replace it. It is useful for chats for
        example.
