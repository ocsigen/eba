###<a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
Ocsigen-start is a set of higher-level libraries for building
client-server web applications with Ocsigen (Js_of_ocaml and
Eliom). It provides modules for
* user management (session management, registration, activation keys, ...),
* managing groups of users,
* displaying tips, and
* easily sending notifications to the users.

Ocsigen-start is in an early stage of development. More modules will
be added and more customizability.

Ocsigen-start comes with an `eliom-distillery` template for an app
with a database, user management, and session management.  This
template is intended to serve as a basis for quickly building the
Minimum Viable Product for web applications with users. The goal is to
enable the programmer to concentrate on the core of the app, and not
on user management.

If Ocsigen-start corresponds to your needs, it will probably help you
a lot. If not, start with a simpler template. You can still use the
modules from Ocsigen-start.

###<a id="install"></a>Installation

Ocsigen-start has a list of dependencies. All can be installed using opam. Here the commands:
```
opam pin add --no-action -y ocsigenserver https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigenserver.git
opam pin add --no-action -y reactiveData https://github.com/ocsigen/reactiveData.git
opam pin add --no-action -y eliom https://github.com/ocsigen/eliom.git
opam pin add --no-action -y ocsigen-toolkit https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigen-toolkit.git
opam pin add --no-action -y ocsigen-start https://github.com/ocsigen/ocsigen-start.git
opam install ocsigen-start -y
```

Ocsigen-start depends on the [OCaml binding to ImageMagick C library](https://github.com/besport/ocaml-imagemagick) so you need to install the [C library](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

On Mac OSX, you can install it with Homebrew: `brew install imagemagick`.

On Debian/Ubuntu , you can install it with apt-get: `sudo apt-get install libgraphicsmagick1-dev libmagickcore-dev`

`Makefile.mobile` needs `convert` which is an ImageMagick utility. If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, you can install this utility with `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`.
